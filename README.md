# 🐰 Hey Bunny

**AI-Powered Social Media Caption & Image Prompt Generator — Built for Creators, Marketers & Growth Teams**

---

## 🚀 Overview
Hey Bunny is a lightweight, scalable SaaS MVP that automates high-quality social media content generation at scale. It combines Google’s Gemini API (GPT-4-class) with a gamified UX, platform-aware formatting, and prompt-chaining workflows — making it the ideal content copilot for modern creators and growth marketers.

Built entirely in-browser using cutting-edge front-end tools, Hey Bunny delivers instant value with zero backend, proving that great AI products don't have to be heavy to be powerful.

## 🧠 What Sets It Apart

- ⚡ **Bulk Generation Engine**
  Instantly create 15+ platform-specific captions and image prompts with a single click — optimized by topic, tone, and brand voice.

  A stepper-based UI enables fine-tuned content generation using a multi-step workflow for higher-quality results.

- 📱 **Platform-Specific Output**
  Automatically formats content for Instagram, LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube & Facebook — eliminating post-editing.

- 🎮 **Viral-Ready BunnyPoints System**
  A gamified system allows users to earn and spend points for generations. Referral bonuses and sharing unlock more usage, powering viral growth.

- 🔐 **Demo Limits & Paywall Logic**
  Free-tier users get 5 daily generations. “Pro” tier unlocks unlimited usage (toggleable in demo). Ready for Stripe/LemonSqueezy integration.

- 🧪 **In-Browser AI Demos**
  Includes live ML demos (sentiment analysis, object detection, image classification) via TensorFlow.js — no backend required.
