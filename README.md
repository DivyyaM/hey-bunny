## What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Analytics Dashboard:**
  - Tracks logins, caption generations, and post publishing.
  - See daily activity and feature usage at `/dashboard/analytics`.

- **A/B Testing:**
  - Each user is randomly assigned to group A or B.
  - Dashboard UI and features adapt based on group, so you can experiment and learn what works best.

- **ML/NLP Features (All In-Browser):**
  - **Keyword Extraction:** Classic (compromise) and transformer-based (BERT) keyword/entity extraction.
  - **Caption Rewriting:** Instantly rewrite captions in different styles (Casual, SEO, Professional).
  - **Engagement Prediction:** Predicts if a caption will have low, medium, or high engagement.
  - **Tagging & Emoji Generation:** Assigns tags and emojis based on caption content.
  - **Sentiment Analysis:** See if your caption is positive, negative, or neutral.
  - **Semantic Search:** Find related captions by meaning, not just keywords.
  - **Multi-Label & Zero-Shot Classification:** Assigns multiple tags, or lets you define your own categories.
  - **Summarization & Toxicity Detection:** Summarize captions and check for safe content.

- **Model Playground:**
  - Try out and compare different ML models side-by-side at `/dashboard/playground`.

- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Thumbs up/down for captions and rewrites, with persistent feedback stats.
